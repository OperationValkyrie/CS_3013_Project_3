Massachusetts Driver Problem

Phase 1
Given the apporach that the first car who arrives gets to use the intersection
until they are completed, this approach would have a car thread lock 
the mutex and then proceed to follow their direction. They would
only release the mutex after leaving. The problem with this
approach is that there a lack of parrellism and threrefore slow and 
not effecient.

Phase 2
If every driver attempts to use the intersection and only stops
if the quardent they want is filled, this possibliy produces
a deadlock if four cars come from each direction and all want to 
make a left turn. It creates a circular deadlock. The solution to this
would be to check the number of open slots of the intersection before
entering. If a car wants to make a left and there is only one open slots
then just wait until a car clears its first quardent. (and run another check)
