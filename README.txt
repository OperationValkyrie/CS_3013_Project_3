Project 3

This project is split into two different parts. The Pirates vs Ninjas
simulates a costume department where neither of the two type can be inside
at the same time. The solution use semaphores with threads who would check
the next person in line two determine who should be sent in and when a 
customer would wait becuase the other type was inside.
Further information can be found in the problem1_explanation.txt.

The Massachusetts Driver's Problem simulates an intersection where
maximum efficieny must be achieved without deadlocking the intersection.
The solution use mutexs and condition broadcasts to signal to cars that
a particular space was now clear. A whiteboard was also used to keep track of
current car positions.
